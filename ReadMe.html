To accelerate the renewable material development process, build a High-efficiency Organic Solar Cell Detector
to detect the potential organic molecules candidates that are likely to absorb the most sunlight.

Collected historical data from 100,000+ chemical structures based on computational DFT (density functional
theory) results with more than 200 different structural informatic features based on domain knowledge. Trained
and optimized the binary classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost).

The top-performing model achieved a precision score of 0.81 with XGBoost which reduced the computational
time by 80%. Optimized molecule designing based on insights drawn from feature importance analysis of model.
